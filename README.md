# Interesting Word Counter


##Interesting words: 
I have taken this to mean ambiguous words. These i have defined as words with a high number of different types (nouns, verbs etc.) of following words.

If a word is always followed a noun it is not interesting.  If it is followed in one case by a noun in another by an adverb in another by a verb etc. it is interesting. 

I donâ€™t know if this is linguistically significant but it was interesting to me.  

The program outputs a table of the most common of these words and their sentence contexts as a csv.
